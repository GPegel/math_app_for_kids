Math App for Kids

The goal of this App is to traing young kids between 7 and 10 years old to learn how to multiply within a descent amount of time according to the currents standards used at the local elementary schools.

For now, only the multiplying part will be build. In the future I want to add more functionality like adding, subtracting and dividing.

Feel free to fork this repo and any kind of help is really appreciated.

# To-Do list
- Create user profile and save it for later use
- Multiply questions from 1 to 5 and 10 (eg. 1x1, 4x3, 8x5 and 6x10)
- Add two levels, hard and easy (eg. give answer within 4 seconds and 10 seconds)
- The right answer is among other answers but can be selected directly on screen without using keyboard
- Right answers gives positive feedback, wrong answers negative
- Speed of answering will be stored to create graph so any kind of progress in answering-speed can be viewed over time
- And what else comes up while creating this app
